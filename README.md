try-nbdev
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

I was first made aware of **nbdev** while listening to the *Python Bytes
Podcast*, [Episode
300](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/300/a-jupyter-merge-driver-for-git),
where they talked about *A Jupyter merge driver for git*. That made
reference to an article at *fast.ai*, [The Jupyter+git problem is now
solved](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2022-08-25-jupyter-git.html).

This learning project is mostly following the nbdev [End-To-End
Walkthrough](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html#enabling-github-pages)
after watching the [nbdev tutorial - zero to published project in 90
minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7zS8Ld4_iA) on YouTube.

## Install

Not sure you should. :wink:

``` sh
pip install try_nbdev
```

## How to use

This module provides little of any use, but it will say hello.

``` python
print(say_hello("Y'all"))
```

    Hello, Y'all.
